# First assignment

## Feelings  

**I'm excited to attend this course**, I'm confident that it will be very useful for me now that I'm finalizing my PhD project and planning the postdoc period. I found out about the course via our mailing list at the University of Eastern Finland. I'm also a bit nervous since I haven't used R before and it seems somewhat difficult at the moment.  

## Expectations  

I'm expecting to learn about new more advanced data analysis methods, especially *linear mixed models and principal component analysis*. Model validation is also new for me.
